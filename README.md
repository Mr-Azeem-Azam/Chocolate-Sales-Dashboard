💡 Problem Statement

The chocolate company wanted to analyze its overall sales performance and delivery efficiency across different products and salespersons.
They needed to identify performance gaps, best-selling products, and revenue contribution by each salesperson.

🧩 Case Study – Chocolate Sales Dashboard 2023
🧾 Dataset Overview

The dataset contained 4,998 rows and 7 columns, including Date, Product, Boxes, Amount, Salesperson, Country, and Order Status.
The data was originally downloaded from a public sample dataset (GitHub source) and then cleaned and formatted in Excel before loading into Power BI.

⚙️ Process & Steps
1️⃣ Data Cleaning (Excel)

Removed null values and ensured consistent formatting

Verified numeric columns (Boxes, Amount)

Saved final dataset for Power BI import

2️⃣ Data Modeling (Power BI)

Created DAX measures for key KPIs:

Total Sales = SUM(Amount)

Total Boxes = SUM(Boxes)

Total Orders = COUNTROWS(Data)

Delivery Rate = Delivered Orders / Total Orders

Average Order Value = SUM(Amount)/COUNTROWS(Data)

Added calculated columns and proper data types.

3️⃣ Dashboard Design

Used a chocolate-themed color palette #6B4226, #D7C7AD, #F8F4E3.
Included visuals:

Line Chart → Monthly Sales Trend

Donut Chart → Order Status Breakdown

Bar Chart → Top 5 Products by Sales

Horizontal Bar → Sales by Salesperson

Scatter Chart → Boxes vs Sales

KPI cards (Total Sales, Total Orders, Delivery Rate, etc.)

📈 Key Insights

Delivered Orders: 83% of all orders (Strong fulfillment rate)

Cancelled Orders: 4.5% — may indicate product unavailability

Top 2 Salespersons: Contribute 15% of total revenue

Best-Selling Product: Choco Coated Almonds

Peak Sales Months: April–July, showing high seasonal demand

🏁 Outcome

This dashboard provides an end-to-end business view of chocolate sales — helping management quickly identify performance gaps, best products, and efficient salespersons.
The project demonstrates practical Power BI dashboard design, data cleaning, and insight extraction skills.
